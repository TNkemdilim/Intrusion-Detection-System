This repository contains the machine learning implementation of the Intrusion Detection System. it uses the backpropogation algorithm 
to train neural network written in Octave-Matlab.
I have refered the code of Andrew NG tutorials' on Coursera and used the same to predict Intrusion accuracy on training set itself.

The dataset used is a small version of KDD dataset for IDS. 
the training data is used in such a way that only the numerical entries of the dataset are used in calculation. Thus the fields 
like the "protocol" etc are eliminated. The dataset information is shown in the papers folder in the repo.

I have used only 7000 training examples each with 37 features described in the "papers to refer" folder's first pdf file.
The accuracy obtained is 83% and more can be achived if more training data is made available.
